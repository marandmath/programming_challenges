# programming_challenges
Solutions to programming challenges across Advent of Code, Codewars and Project Euler. Currently doing the 2015 days in Advent of Code, Codewars' Jupyter Notebook 
with solutions and theory needs to be updated to the current challenges (as of September 2021), and just recently started tackling the Project Euler challenges.
