# Programming Challenges
Solutions to selected programming challenges across Advent of Code, Codewars and Project Euler. Currently doing the challenges in 2015 for Advent of Code. Jupyter notebook 
with the Codewars solutions and theory needs to be updated to the current challenges (as of September 2021). Also, I started recently tackling some of the Project Euler challenges.
