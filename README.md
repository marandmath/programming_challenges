# Programming Challenges
Solutions to selected programming challenges across Advent of Code, Codewars and Project Euler. Currently doing the challenges in 2015 for Advent of Code. Codewars' Jupyter Notebook 
with solutions and theory needs to be updated to the current challenges (as of September 2021). Also started recently tackling the Project Euler challenges.
